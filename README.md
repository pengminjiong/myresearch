# myresearch

this file contains the source code of my first research in the university of tokyo.

It has two parts: 

1. poission part: source code about how to generate poisson arrival timgs(poisson1.py), how to verify these timigs are 
follow possion_process(poisson2.py). Additionally, a script(poissontxt.py) that generates  a list of poisson timings that can be used for
NS-3

2. NS-3: soucr code of three simulations.(attention:this part of source code follows ndnsim's guideline)
