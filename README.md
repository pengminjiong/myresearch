# myresearch

this file contains the source code of my first research in the university of tokyo.

It has two parts: 

1. poission part: source code about how to generate poisson arrival timgs(poisson1.py), how to verify these timigs are 
following possion_process(poisson2.py) or not. Additionally, a script(poissontxt.py) that generates  a list of poisson timings that can be used for
NS-3

2. NS-3: source code of three simulations.(attention:this part of source code follows ndnsim's guideline)
simulation source code should be included into NS-3 module(ndnsim1.0, in our simulation)
